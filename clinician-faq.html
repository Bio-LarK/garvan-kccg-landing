This is longer than the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council (NPAAC) minimum requirements.</p> <h3>What are the specimen collection and transport requirements?</h3> <p>For the [G4 Pathology] clinical WGS test, we accept only EDTA blood (minimum of 5mL for adult and 2 mL for paediatric specimens) or DNA (minimum of 100μL at a concentration of 10-100ng/μL).</p> <p>The online request form should be printed and provided to the patient to have EDTA blood collected or sent to a laboratory where DNA is already stored to facilitate sending of the sample to:</p> <address> <strong>SydPath Laboratory</strong><br> 390 Victoria Street<br> Darlinghurst, NSW 2010<br> Australia<br> <abbr title=Phone>Tel:</abbr> +61 2 8382 9100 <abbr title=Fax>Fax:</abbr> +61 2 8382 2489 </address> <p>Patient samples must be shipped at room temperature or with an ice pack but must not be frozen.</p> <p>Blood samples should arrive at SydPath Central Specimen Reception within 3 days after collection. Sample transportation requirements are in line with NPAAC Requirements for Packaging and Transport of Path specimens and associated materials.</p> <h3>What information will the final report contain?</h3> <p>The [G4 Pathology] clinical WGS report will contain information on clinically significant or potentially significant variants. The report will also contain clinically relevant incidental findings. However, patients will be able to discuss this further with their referring clinician during the consenting process and choose whether they would like to be informed of these findings or not. </p> <p>This is a diagnostic request form and so only variants with established disease associations will be reported. For children, genes causing purely adult onset diseases without preventative management in childhood will be unanalysed as far as is feasible with current knowledge. Analysis should be limited to gene panels extracted from WGS or paediatric onset disorders only.</p> <p>In addition, adults may request a gene panel but may not have adult onset disorders excluded from analysis. Carrier status for autosomal recessive conditions may be undertaken but will only be confirmed and reported for adults or after consultation with the referring doctor in older teenagers who have reached sufficient maturity to undergo independent counselling and consent themselves (usually over the age of 16 years).</p> <h3>How will it be delivered?</h3> <p>The ordering clinician will be notified by SMS message when the report is complete. At this time, the report can also be retrieved electronically and will also delivered by either regular post and/or fax (as specified at time of ordering). </p> <h3>Does [G4 Pathology] offer re-analysis of samples?</h3> <p>Genomics is a rapidly evolving field where our understanding about which genes are implicated in a range of genetic disorders is constantly expanding. It is possible for the requesting geneticist to re-analyse WGS data as new genes are identified or if the clinical situation has changed. If you are considering this, please contact [G4 pathology] on (02) 9359 8002.</p> <h3>What does the test cost for a private patient?</h3> <p>The [G4 Pathology] clinical WGS test is $4,990 (excl. GST) for the proband and $3,390 (excl. GST) for each additional family member. [Julie to confirm whether GST applies]. This cost is subject to change. Please visit http://genomicpathology.garvan.org.au to confirm.</p> <p>Private patients are required to complete a financial consent form and pay the full cost of the [G4 Pathology] clinical WGS before testing can commence. An invoice will be mailed to the email address nominated on the financial consent form.</p> <p>We accept payment by BPAY only. Once payment is received we will email you a receipt, which has been coordinated with our specimen management system and commence WGS.</p> <div class=well> <h3>Privacy Notice</h3> <p>We collect, use and hold your credit card details to process your payment for our services.
