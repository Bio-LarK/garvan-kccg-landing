Clinical WGS relies on a new form of genetic testing called genomic testing which enables most genes to be tested at the one time.</p> <p>The [G4 pathology] Clinical WGS can only be ordered by a specialist physician. </p> <p>If you have any questions about this test or its suitability for your patient, please contact one of our clinical geneticists or genetic counsellors by calling (02) 9359 8002.</p> <h3>What is Whole Genome Sequencing?</h3> <p>The entire human DNA consists of 3 billion base pairs making up both the coding regions (exomes) as well as the non-coding regions (approx. 99% of the entire DNA). The exome regions contain approximately 20,000 genes, which encode proteins. These regions are relatively well understood and have therefore been the focus of sequencing tests so far. However, there is increasing evidence for the regulatory role of non-coding DNA and therefore their potential involvement in inherited disorders. </p> <p>Whole genome sequencing test involves sequencing the patient’s entire DNA in a single test with the aim of arriving at a diagnosis, rather than focusing on the exomes or even individual genes only. Whole genome sequencing offers potential advantages over traditional genetic testing or exome sequencing by producing a greater diagnostic yield and reducing the time to diagnosis.</p> <h3>When should WGS be ordered?</h3> <p>This test is appropriate for patients where family history and/or physical examination suggest an inherited disorder. This includes patients:</p> <ul> <li> With a broad differential diagnosis or clinical presentation potentially associated with many genes, where single gene/panel testing is unlikely to provide a definitive answer</li> <li> Where alternative testing options are too time-consuming and/or more costly; or </li> <li> Who have undergone other tests that have failed to produce a diagnosis. </li> </ul> <h3> How does it compare to exome sequencing? </h3> <p> [G4 Pathology] Clinical WGS provides enhanced diagnosis rates (40 – 60%) compared to exome sequencing (30%) resulting in potentially reduced time and cost to diagnosis. This is due to a consistently high coverage across the diagnostically important areas (20x coverage over 96% of protein-coding genes), the increased potential for structural variant detection, and the sequencing and analysis of non-coding areas {REF}. </p> <table class="table table-bordered"> <tr> <th> <th>Microarrays <th>Single Gene / Panel Tests <th>Typical Exome Tests <th>[G4 clinical WGS test]  <tr> <td>Diagnosis Rate for difficult (unsolved) cases <td> Variable  <td> Variable  <td> 20 – 30%  <td> 40 – 60%   <tr> <td> Exome-wide sequence coverage  <td> <i class="fa fa-times"></i>  <td> <i class="fa fa-times"></i>  <td> (<i class="fa fa-check"></i>)  <td> <i class="fa fa-check"></i>   <tr> <td> Coverage of non-coding clinical SNVs  <td><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <td><i class="fa fa-check"></i> <td><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <td><i class="fa fa-check"></i>  <tr> <td> Interpretation of SNV compound heterozygotes  <td> <i class="fa fa-times"></i>  <td> <i class="fa fa-check"></i>  <td> <i class="fa fa-check"></i>  <td> <i class="fa fa-check"></i>   </table> <h3> Process overview </h3> <div class=media> <div class=pull-left> <p><img class=icons src=images/icons/9cd3e104.obtain-consent.jpg alt=""></p> </div> <div class=media-body> <h4> Specialist-patient discussion </h4> <p> Specialists should discuss the option of conducting a [G4 Pathology] Clinical WGS with patients and their family. Genetic counselling is required prior to proceeding to informed consent and WGS testing. General Practitioners should contact our [G4 Pathology] genetic counsellors on +61 2 9359 8002 or refer their patient to a genetic counsellor or clinical geneticist. </p> <p> The ordering specialist should obtain formal genomic consent from the patient and their family, using a genomic clinical consent form, approved for their state or territory. The NSW Health genomic consent form can be downloaded from [here]. For private patients, please download the [G4 pathology] clinical WGS test consent form [link to our consent form]. In addition, private patients are required to sign a Privacy collection statement and consent form [link to privacy form] as well as a financial consent form [link to financial consent form] agreeing to pay the cost of the WGS test in advance. </p> </div> </div> <div class=media> <div class=pull-left> <p><img class=icons src=images/icons/165d54f7.clinical-request-form.jpg alt=""></p> </div> <div class=media-body> <p> Clinical information in English must accompany each sample, including the diagnosis at referral and inheritance pattern relevant to each family member undergoing genomic analysis. This information should be included in the [G4 Pathology] Clinical WGS Test order form, which can be completed either through our online request form [link to request form] or via a printed version of the form [link to pdf form]. If you require printed copies of the form, please contact us on kccgclinical@garvan.org.au. </p> <p> A completed request form is required for each sample. Guidelines for filling out the form can be accessed here [link to request form instructions] </p> <p> The clinicians are asked to upload the signed genomic consent form. In addition, patient should be provided with a copy of the completed and signed request form, which they should take to a blood collection centre of the SydPath network or any other pathology provider when they have their blood taken. The form may also be directed to a laboratory where patient DNA is already stored. As indicated on the form, blood samples are shipped to: </p> </div> </div> <div class=media> <div class=pull-left> <p><img class=icons src=images/icons/3d044ee9.submit-blood-and-paperwork.jpg alt=""></p> </div> <div class=media-body> <address> <strong>[G4 Pathology] Collection Centre - SydPath</strong><br> 390 Victoria Street<br> Darlinghurst, NSW 2010<br> Australia<br> <abbr title=Phone>Tel:</abbr> +61 2 8382 9100<br> Opening hours for collection: 24 hours, 7 days a week </address> <p> Patient samples must be shipped at room temperature and must not be frozen. </p> <p> Blood samples should arrive at SydPath Central Specimen Reception within 3 days after collection.
