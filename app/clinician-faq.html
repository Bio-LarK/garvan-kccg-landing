        <h2>Clinician Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>


        <h3>Who can order the [G4 Pathology] Whole Genome Screen?</h3>
        <p>The [G4 Pathology] WGS can be ordered by a specialist medical practitioner with an appropriate level of experience.</p>

        <p>At the time of ordering, the requesting practitioner should provide evidence of adequate genomic consent facilitated by a specialist clinician, genetic counsellor or other health practitioner with relevant experience, background and expertise.</p>

        <h3>What paperwork is required to order the [G4 Pathology] Whole Genome Screen?</h3>
        <p>The following forms are required depending on whether the test is ordered for a public or private patient.</p>

        <p>Public Patients	Private Patients
        WGS screen request form	Yes [incl link to our request form [https://apps.kccg.garvan.org.au/clinical-web-request/#/]
        Yes [incl link to our request form [https://apps.kccg.garvan.org.au/clinical-web-request/#/]
        Genetic consent form	Relevant state or territory forms
        G4 Pathology genetic consent form [include link to genetic consent forum]
        Privacy Consent form	?? [Q for Leslie/Tony: are there specific forms for public patients or is that included in the consent forum?]	G4 Pathology Privacy Collection and consent form [include link to financial consent form]
        Financial Consent form	NA	G4 Pathology Financial consent form [incl link]</p>


        <h3>How to complete the WGS screen request form</h3>
        <p>A separate form is required for each referral. If additional WGS requests are required, the first page of the electronic request form will appear again after clicking "Finish".</p>

        <p>The online request form is divided into four pages to obtain information regarding</p>
        <ul>
            <li>patient demographics</li>
            <li>referring practitioner details</li>
            <li>clinical information and</li>
            <li>Request, Specimen and Billing information.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Not all fields are mandatory, however the fields underlined in red must be completed before progressing to the next page of the form.</p>

        <p>Detailed guidance on how to complete the [G4 Pathology] WGS screen request form can be found here. [PDF download]/open in a new window https://www.dropbox.com/s/5by2hvv4i0kffql/Guidance%20for%20Request%20Form_v1.docx?dl=0 ]</p>

        <p>The referring practitioner's online/paper request form is retained for 7 years (adults) and until age 25 (<18 years old) in accordance with the requirements of the Health Records and Information Privacy Act (HRIPA), section 25 and [include full name] HPR, regulation 10. This is longer than the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council (NPAAC) minimum requirements.</p>

        <h3>What are the specimen requirements?</h3>
        <p>For the [G4 Pathology] WGS screen, we accept only EDTA blood (minimum of 5mL for adult and 2 mL for paediatric specimens) or DNA (minimum of 100μL of 10-100ng/μL).</p>

        <p>The online request form may printed and provided to the patient to have EDTA blood collected or sent to a laboratory where DNA is already stored to facilitate sending of the sample to:</p>

        <address>
            <strong>SydPath Laboratory</strong><br>
            390 Victoria Street<br>
            Darlinghurst, NSW 2010<br>
            Australia<br>
            <abbr title="Phone">Tel:</abbr>  +61 2 8382 9100
            <abbr title="Fax">Fax:</abbr>  +61 2 8382 2489
        </address>


        <p>Patient samples must be shipped at room temperature or with an ice pack but must not be frozen.</p>
        <p>Blood samples should arrive at SydPath Central Specimen Reception within 3 days after collection. Sample transportation requirements are in line with NPAAC Requirements for Packaging and Transport of Path specimens and associated materials.</p>



        <h3>What information will the final report contain?</h3>
        <p>The [G4 Pathology] WGS screen report will contain information on clinically significant or potentially significant variants. The report will also contain clinically relevant incidental findings. However, patients will be able to discuss this further with their referring clinician during the consenting process and choose whether they would like to be informed of these findings or not.</p>

        <p>This is a diagnostic request form and so only variants with established disease associations will be reported. For children, genes causing purely adult onset diseases without preventative management in childhood will be unanalysed as far as is feasible with current knowledge. Analysis should be limited to gene panels extracted from WGS/WES or paediatric onset disorders only.</p>

        <p>In addition, adults may request a gene panel but may not have adult onset disorders excluded from analysis.  Carrier status for autosomal recessive conditions may be undertaken but will only be confirmed and reported for adults or after consultation with the referring doctor in older teenagers who have reached sufficient maturity to undergo independent counselling and consent themselves (usually over the age of 16 years).</p>


        <h3>How will it be delivered?</h3>


        <h3>Does [G4 Pathology] offer re-analysis of samples?</h3>
        <p>Genomics is a rapidly evolving field where our understanding about which genes are implicated in a range of genetic disorders is constantly expanding. It is possible to re-analyse a field with new genes and variants If you are considering, please contact…</p>


        <h3>What does the test cost for a private patient?</h3>
        <p>The price for the proband is $4,990 and $3,390 for each further family member.</p>

        <p>Private patients are required to complete a financial consent form and pay the full cost of the [G4 Pathology] WGS screen before testing can commence. An invoice will be mailed to the email address nominated on the financial consent form.</p>
        <p>We accept payment by Credit Card [Visa, MasterCard and American Express] or BPAY only. Once payment is received we will email you a receipt, which has been coordinated with our specimen management system, to commence the screening test.</p>
         

        <h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
        <p>We collect, use and hold your credit card details to process your payment for our services.  Please refer to the section "Your privacy" [include link] on this website.</p>
        <p>We are unable to accept payment in cash or by personal cheque.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about payment options, or are experiencing financial hardship, please contact [G4 Pathology] Patient liaison on [include phone number] or kccgclinical@garvan.org.au .</p>


        <h3>What sequencing platform does [G4 pathology] use for its test?</h3>
        <p>The [G4 Pathology] whole genome-sequencing screen is conducted using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform.</p>

        <p>Data specifications	HiSeq X Reagent Kit v2.5</p>
        <p>>100 Gb raw data</p>
        <p>>75% bases >= Q30 at 2x 150bp</p>
        <p>Genome coverage >= 30x as defined by Illumina</p>

        <p>For more detailed information about the sequencing platform, the bioinformatics pipeline and its performance across certain areas of the genome or indeed individual genes please contact [G4 pathology] on [include number of patient liaison].</p>
