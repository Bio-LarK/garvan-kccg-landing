        <h2>Patient frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>

        <h3>What does whole genome sequencing do?</h3>
        <p>Whole Genome Sequencing relies on a new form of genetic testing called genomic testing which is used to identify causes of genetic conditions. Whole genome sequencing enables most genes to be tested at the one time.</p>

        <h3>What are chromosomes and genes?</h3>
        <p>Each body cell contains chromosomes, which store genetic information. These genetic instructions control the development of all body organs and how they work.  Body cells usually contain 46 chromosomes, arranged as 23 pairs according to their size. One of each of these pairs is inherited from our father and the other from our mother. The first 22 pairs of chromosomes are similar in men and women. The 23rd pair is called the sex chromosomes. These are called XX in women and XY in men. The picture shows a cell containing chromosomes. One chromosome is enlarged and shows that it consists of DNA from which genes are made.</p>

        <p>There are about 20,000 genes in each cell. All of these genes make up the “genome” in the cell. Just like chromosomes, genes also usually come in pairs, one from each parent. Genes contain information in the form of code words that the cell “reads”. Each gene has a specific function, however the function of all genes is not yet known.</p>
        <p>Variations in genetic information in different people make us all unique. Some variations are harmless but others can make a gene not work (called a mutation). Identifying mutations may help to find the cause of the genetic condition which may be important for you and other relatives. Genetic mutations can be inherited from one or both parents or may occur for the first time in a person at conception.</p>

        <h3>Why is genomic testing done?</h3>
        <p>Previously, testing to look for mutations involved examining only one gene at a time. It could therefore take many years to identify the cause of a condition, especially if the condition was one caused by mutations in one of several genes. It is now possible to test all 20,000 genes at the same time by WGS. This means that the cause of a genetic condition may be detected within a shorter time period.</p>

        <h3>Which genes will be tested?</h3>
        <p>You can make a choice to test the genes first that are already known to be involved in causing or increasing the risk for the specific genetic condition in you or your family. If no gene mutations are identified, or if you and your doctor choose, all genes may be analyzed through WGS.</p>

        <h3>What are the possible outcomes of genomic testing?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A gene mutation is identified that is the cause of the genetic condition. Your doctor will discuss these results with you and the meaning of the results for you and your relatives. It is your choice whether you will inform your relatives to give them the opportunity to participate in genetic testing.  Your family will not be approached by your doctor or genetic counsellor unless you give permission or it is required by urgent medical circumstances.</li>
            <li>One or more gene variations are identified where the significance is not clear. Additional testing of other relatives may help to determine if the result is relevant in causing the genetic condition. </li>
            <li>One or more genetic variations are identified which are known to be harmless and not to cause genetic conditions. These will not be discussed with you.</li>
            <li>Rarely, one or more genetic mutations that are not related to the genetic condition being investigated are found by chance.  These are called co-incidental findings. An example of this could be a gene mutation associated with an increased risk of a serious health problem in you or your relatives. These results will be assessed by an independent committee of experts in collaboration with your doctor or genetic counsellor. The findings will be discussed with you if they could have important consequences for you or other family members. You will have had an opportunity to discuss this with your referring doctor prior to completing the consent form.</li>
            <li>No gene mutations are identified that could explain the genetic condition. In this situation, more testing may be available in the future. The timeframe for this is uncertain.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Who can order whole genome sequencing (WGS)?</h3>
        <p>WGS is only available on request from your treating specialist.</p>

        <h3>What results will I get?</h3>
        <p>Your specialist will receive a [G4 Pathology] report that lists any clinically-significant or potentially significant variants in your genome that are related to your condition.</p>

        <h3>Will I get data back?</h3>
        <p>[Can they request the data? Public: owned by the pathologist. Done privately, then yes.]
            Your referring specialist will discuss these results with you in person.
        </p>

        <h3>How long will it take?</h3>
        <p>The timeframe for completion of the WGS and the return of the results to your treating practitioner is approximately 6-8 weeks. However, there may be variation in the time taken depending on factors such as workload and urgency.</p>

        <h3>What does the WGS screen cost for a private patient?</h3>
        <p>For a private patient the cost of the [G4 Pathology] Clinical WGS test is $4,990 (excl. GST) and $3,390 (excl. GST) for additional family members. This cost is subject to change. Please visit http://genomicpathology.garvan.org.au to confirm. The test is currently not covered by Medicare or private health insurances.  For patients treated in public hospitals the cost of WGS may be covered by the hospital. If unsure whether you qualify as public patient or not please check with your specialist. </p>
        <p>
            You must pay the cost of the [G4 Pathology] WGS analysis before testing commences.
            The cost of [G4 Pathology] WGS does not include the fees or charges payable to a clinical geneticist your treating specialist may recommend you consult before undergoing the test.
        </p>

        <h3>What payment methods are accepted?</h3>
        <p>We only accept payments via BPay. This facility is available for patients with an Australian bank account. Contact your banking institution to check the daily transfer limits prior to allow for payment.  International patients without an Australian bank account are requested to pay via international bank transfer into Australian dollars.  The patient is responsible for any banking transaction and conversion fees. <strong>We are unable to accept payment in cash or by personal cheque.</strong></p>
