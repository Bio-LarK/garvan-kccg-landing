        <h2>Patient frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h2>

        <h3>What does whole genome sequencing do?</h3>
        <p>The WGS screening test relies on a new form of genetic testing called genomic testing which is used to find causes of genetic conditions. WGS screening enables most genes to be tested at the one time.</p>



        <h3>What are chromosomes and genes?</h3>
        <p>Each body cell contains chromosomes, which store genetic information. These genetic instructions control the development of all body organs and how they work.  Body cells usually contain 46 chromosomes, arranged as 23 pairs according to their size. One of each of these pairs is inherited from our father and the other from our mother. The first 22 pairs of chromosomes are similar in men and women. The 23rd pair is called the sex chromosomes. These are called XX in women and XY in men. ‘</p>

        <p>The picture shows a cell containing chromosomes. One chromosome is enlarged and shows that it consists of DNA from which genes are made.</p>

        <p>There are about 20,000 genes in each cell. All of these genes make up the “genome” in the cell. Just like the chromosomes, the genes also usually come in pairs, one from each parent. Genes contain information for the cells of the body to function in the form of code words that the cell “reads”. Each gene has a specific function, however the function of all genes is not yet known.
        Variations in genetic information in different people can occur which is why we are all unique. Some variations are harmless but others can make a gene not work (called a mutation). Identifying mutations may help to find the cause of the genetic condition in you or your family which may be important for you, the affected individuals and other blood relatives. Genetic mutations can be inherited from one or both parents or may occur for the first time in a person before or during their conception.</p>

        <h3>Why is genomic testing done?</h3>
        <p>Previously, testing to look for mutations involved examining only one gene at a time. It could therefore take many years to identify the cause of the condition, especially if the condition is one that may be caused by mutations in one of several genes. It is now possible to test all 20,000 genes at the same time by genomic testing. This means that the cause of a genetic condition may be detected within a shorter time period.</p>

        <h3>Which genes will be tested?</h3>
        <p>Firstly, genes that are already known to be involved in directly causing or increasing risk for the specific genetic condition in you or your family will be tested. If no gene mutations are found, or if you and your doctor choose to go directly to testing all genes first, then genomic testing of all the 20,000 genes will occur.</p>

        <p>What are the possible outcomes of testing by genomic testing?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A gene mutation is found that is the cause of the genetic condition. Your doctor will discuss these results with you and the meaning of the results for you and your blood relatives. It is your choice whether you will inform your relatives to give them the opportunity to participate in genetic testing.  Your family will not be approached by your doctor or genetic counsellor unless you give permission or it is required by urgent medical circumstances.</li>
            <li>One or more gene variations are found where the significance is not clear. Additional testing of other blood relatives may help to determine if the result is relevant in causing the genetic condition.</li>
            <li>One or more genetic variations are found which are known to be harmless and not to cause genetic conditions. These will not be discussed with you.</li>
            <li>Rarely, one or more genetic mutations that are not related to the genetic condition being investigated are found by chance.  These are called co-incidental findings. An example of this could be a gene mutation associated with an increased risk of a serious health problem in you or your blood relatives. These results will be assessed by an independent committee of experts in collaboration with your doctor or genetic counsellor. The findings will be discussed with you if they could have important consequences for you or other family members. You will have had an opportunity to discuss this with your referring doctor prior to completing the consent form.</li>
            <li>No gene mutations are found that could explain the genetic condition. In this situation, more testing may be available in the future. The timeframe for this is unknown.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Who can order whole genome sequencing (WGS)?</h3>
        <p>Our whole genome-sequencing (WGS) screen is only available on request from your treating specialist.</p>

        <h3>What results will I get?</h3>
        <p>Your specialist will receive a [G4 Pathology] report that lists any clinically-significant or potentially significant variants in your genome that are related to your condition.</p>

        <h3>Will I get data back?</h3>
        <p>[Can they request the data? Public: owned by the pathologist. Done privately, then yes.]
        Your medical specialist will discuss these results with you in person.</p>

        <h3>Can I order a WGS screen without referral from a specialist?</h3>
        <p>No. Our whole genome-sequencing (WGS) screen is only available on request from your treating specialist.</p>

        <h3>How long will it take?</h3>
        <p>The timeframe for completion of WGS screening and the return of the results to your treating practitioner is approximately 6-8 weeks, however there may be variation in the time taken depending on factors such as workload and urgency.</>

        <h3>What does the WGS screen cost?</h3>
        <p>For a private patient the cost of the [G4 Pathology] WGS screening test is [$4,990]. Currently, Medicare does not cover the [G4 Pathology] WGS screening test.  This means that you will not be entitled to claim a Medicare benefit or rebate or any re-imbursement from a private health insurer for this test.  For patients treated in public hospitals the cost of the test may be covered by the hospital. If unsure whether you qualify as public patient or not please check with your specialist.
        The test makes use of advanced technology available only in specialist centres. [G4 Pathology] is committed to making specialist genomic pathology services as accessible and affordable as possible for all patients.  For some people, a [G4 Pathology] WGS screening test may result in fewer out-of-pocket costs than the alternative of undergoing numerous single gene tests.  Please ask your treating specialist about the likely costs of other diagnostic options so that you can compare these costs.
        The cost of the [G4 Pathology] WGS screening test does not include the fees or charges payable to a clinical geneticist your treating specialist may recommend you consult before undergoing the screening test.</p>
